# Resume Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the resume PDF file. In a real implementation, you would:

1. Create a professional PDF resume
2. Save it as `resume.pdf` in the `public` folder
3. The download functionality will work automatically

## Instructions:
- Replace this file with your actual resume in PDF format
- Name it exactly `resume.pdf`
- Place it in the `public` folder

The portfolio is configured to download this file when users click the "Download Resume" buttons.
